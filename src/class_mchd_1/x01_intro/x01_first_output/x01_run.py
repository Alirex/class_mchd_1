#   Can be useful for some demo-code.
#   `ipykernel` in the environment is required for that (available with `jupyter`).
#   Works in some IDEs:
#       - PyCharm (At least Pro) (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/scientific-project-tutorial.html#execute-code-cells)
#       - VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py)
